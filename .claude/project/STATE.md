# State

## In progress
Manual start/stop recording (branch `feature/manual-recording`).
Step 1 done: progressive Mp4Muxer + journal/Recover (commit 3855739).
Verified: Debug build 0 warnings; `--unittest` 321 passed/0 failed/0 skipped (also with CLINK_TESTS_NO_SKIP=1 and CLINK_EMULATE_ELST=1).

## Key decisions
- moov-at-end + sidecar journal chosen over fragmented MP4: keeps box layout identical to clips so Trimmer/ClipSource/ClipAlignment/clk1 brand work unchanged; fMP4 would risk MF edit-list and seeking behaviour.
- Recording shares the replay encoder (quality = replay quality).
- Recording starts from the ring's last keyframe at or before the hotkey (<=1 GOP pre-roll), no forced IDR.
- Engine restarts (settings change, display change, sleep, pause) end the current part; controller starts a new part.
- Recordings land in `<ClipsFolder>\Recordings\`; in-progress files use `.mp4.rec` in the final directory.

## Sink contract (Mp4Muxer progressive mode)
- Single owner thread for Write*/Flush/Finish/Discard/Dispose.
- Flush(false) every 1-2 s, Flush(true) every 10-30 s (FlushFileBuffers stalls).
- Know avcC before CreateProgressive (SPS/resolution change => new file).
- Stop before DurationLimit() with a margin using VideoElapsed100ns, or catch DurationLimitException then Finish.
- Any other Write* exception => stop writing, Dispose, Recover.
- Finish throws => do not retry on the instance; Dispose then Recover.
- "Nothing recorded" => Discard.
- Startup recovery: Recover each *.rec with .idx not currently live (IOException => in use, skip; null => keep files, don't delete); delete orphan .idx without .rec; delete header-only .rec without .idx.
- Ensure the final directory exists; read FinalPath after Finish.

## Known limits
- Index memory ~20-40 MB/h (cap parts at ~4 h).
- 32-bit duration limit ~13.25 h.
- Trimmer loads whole selections in memory (unsuitable for hours-long files until seek-and-stream).

## Next action
Step 2: incremental ClipWriter (see TASKS.md).
